# Generate Music from Humming

This documentation provides an overview of the "Generate Music from Humming" application. These images depict different stages of music generation, pitch detection, and model metrics.

---

## Filtering Detected Pitches
Filtering is the first step in the pitch detection pipeline, where unwanted frequencies are removed to enhance accuracy.

---

## Original Annotations
This image shows the original pitch annotations, which serve as a ground truth for evaluating the pitch detection model.

---

## Comparing Original and Detected Pitches
This comparison helps in analyzing the accuracy of the detected pitches against the original annotations.

## Smoothened Pitches
After detecting pitches, they are smoothened to improve the overall melody flow.

## Polyphonic Music
This plot represents the polyphonic generated music, showcasing multiple notes played simultaneously.
